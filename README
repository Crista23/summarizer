TopicSum summarizer library
===========================

Installation
------------

To build and install TopicSum summarizer library execute the following:

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ make check
  $ make install

"make install" may require superuser privileges.

** Hint on install location **

  By default, the package will be installed to /usr/local.  However, on many
  platforms, /usr/local/lib is not part of LD_LIBRARY_PATH. You can add it, but
  it may be easier to just install to /usr instead.  To do this, invoke
  configure as follows:

    ./configure --prefix=/usr

  If you already built the package with a different prefix, make sure
  to run "make clean" before building again.

** Compiling dependent packages **

  To compile a package that uses TopicSum, you need to pass various flags to
  your compiler and linker. TopicSum integrates with pkg-config to manage this.
  If you have pkg-config installed, then you can invoke it to get a list of
  flags like so:

    pkg-config --cflags summarizer         # print compiler flags
    pkg-config --libs summarizer           # print linker flags
    pkg-config --cflags --libs summarizer  # print both

  For example:

    g++ my_program.cc `pkg-config --cflags --libs summarizer`

  If you are writing an autoconf-based package that uses TopicSum, you should
  probably use the PKG_CHECK_MODULES macro in your configure script like:

    PKG_CHECK_MODULES([summarizer], [summarizer])

  See the pkg-config man page for more info.
