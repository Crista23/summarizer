The U.S. Mint said it is seeking offers on 3,701,000 lbs of electrolytic copper and 629,000 lbs of electrolytic cut nickel cathodes or briquettes that it intends to purchase.
It said both metals are for delivery in the week of May 11 to Olin Corp, East Alton, Ill.

Offers for the copper are due by 1100 hrs EDT, April 21, while offers on the nickel are due at 1100 hrs EDT on April 14.
The Mint said that firms, in submitting their offers, select to receive payment by standard check or be wire transfer.

The minimum acceptance periods for each solicitation is three calendar days for the copper and 10 calendar days for the nickel, the Mint said.
Sumitomo Metal Mining Co said it will raise its monthly nickel output to around 1,750 tonnes from April 1 from 1,650 now because of increased domestic demand, mainly from stainless steel makers.
Sumitomo produced 1,800 tonnes of a nickel a month until end-1986, but cut output in January because of stagnant demand, a company official said.
Calendar 1987 production is likely to fall to around 20,000 tonnes from 22,000 in 1986 as a result of the first quarter reduction, he said.
Sumitomo is Japan's only nickel producer.
SAFT, a unit of Cie Generale d'Electricite of France, said it bought U.K.-based Alcad Ltd from Penn Central Corp's Marathon Manufacturing Cos Inc.

Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
Alcad is one of the world's largest producers of pocket-plate nickel-cadmium storeage batteries, used in industrial and railroad applications to start engines and as light sources, SAFT said.
SAFT said it expects to add 400 jobs at the U.K. operations.
